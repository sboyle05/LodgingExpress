###
For this project it originally started out as Lodging Express.
The more I worked on this project I realized the name didn't fit. My love of travel and love of fantasy books including The Wheel of Time and Lord of the Rings gave my project a theme. 
My spots without planning had already provided a better path for my name.
ONCE UPON A STAY.
Let our lantern guide you on your journey.

This project was built with a variety of technologies.
The backend is based on an express database that incorporated SQL and Sequelize.
The frontend is built on a react-redux framework. CSS was used to style the site.

To launch the website you can visit https://lodging-express.onrender.com/ or after npm-i on your local machine you can use npm start to launch in your browser. This requires both the frontend folder and backend folder to be installed and running at the same time.
